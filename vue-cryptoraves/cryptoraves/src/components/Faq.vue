          <div id="hodler" slot="title">What is a “Hodler”?</div>
          <div slot="answer">
            A “hodler” is any other Cryptoraves user who has your personalized
            token in their portfolio.
            <br />
            <br />The term “hodl” is a popular term within the cryptosphere describing
            how crypto investors plan to “hold,” or not sell, their crypto
            tokens. It was a misspelling that became a meme & is commonly used
            within the cryptosphere. A hodler is therefore someone who is
            hodling your tokens, or any other crypto tokens, until they increase
            in value.
